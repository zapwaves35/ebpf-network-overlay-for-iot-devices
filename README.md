# ebpf-network-overlay-for-iot-devices
Network overlay using ebpf to connect iot devices to their server. 

I wanted to use this project to learn three concepts. 
1. ebpf networking
2. infrastructure as code
3. continuous delivery

ebpf will be used to setup IPSec tunnels between multiple linux devices.
I will look at a hybrid cloud approach where cloud infrastructure will be used for the CI/CD pipeline then deployed to on premise devices.
